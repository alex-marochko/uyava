# Concepts: Events, Nodes, Edges

Uyava models your app as a graph:

- **Nodes** represent logical parts of your system (features, services, or UI modules).
- **Edges** describe relationships or flows between nodes, including bidirectional links.
- **Events** are time-ordered signals that animate the graph and show movement.

Nodes can carry metadata like tags, colors, and descriptions. They can also show lifecycle state (initialized or disposed) for quick health checks.
