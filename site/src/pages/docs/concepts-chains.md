# Concepts: Event Chains

Event chains show how one action propagates through your system. Use them to:

- Trace root causes of a behavior.
- Validate expected event sequences.
- Review how data moves across layers.

In the desktop app, chains can be replayed from recorded sessions for offline analysis.
