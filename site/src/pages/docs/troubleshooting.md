# Troubleshooting

## No data appears

Make sure your app is running with DevTools enabled and the Uyava extension is connected to the correct session.

## Graph feels slow

Use filters to reduce the visible graph or collapse parent nodes to keep the viewport responsive.

## Desktop app cannot connect

Confirm the desktop app is pointing to the right VM service endpoint and that firewalls allow local connections.
