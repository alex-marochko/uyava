# Concepts: Filtering and Grouping

Filtering keeps the graph readable as your app grows. You can filter by:

- Tags and categories
- Nodes or edges
- Event severity or type
- Logical expressions (AND/OR)

Grouping lets you collapse parent nodes to keep the top-level view clean while still accessing details on demand.
