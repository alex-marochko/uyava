# Quick Tour

## Graph view

The graph view is the heart of Uyava. It shows nodes (systems, features, or services) and edges (relationships or flows). Nodes can be grouped and expanded for nested visibility.

## Filters

Use filters to narrow the graph by tags, nodes, edges, or event criteria. This keeps large apps readable and helps you focus on the active flow.

## Event chains

Event chains highlight causality. Follow a chain to understand why a state change happened and what it triggered.
