# Getting Started

Uyava is a developer tool for Flutter that visualizes architecture and runtime activity as a 2D graph. It comes in two parts:

- **DevTools Extension (Free):** runs inside Flutter DevTools for day-to-day debugging.
- **Desktop App (Pro):** provides recording and replay workflows for offline analysis.

If you are new to Uyava, start with the DevTools extension to explore your running app. When you need to capture longer sessions or analyze offline, move to the desktop app.

## What you need

- A Flutter app that can run with DevTools enabled.
- The Uyava DevTools extension (once published) or a local build.
- Optional: the desktop app for Pro workflows.
