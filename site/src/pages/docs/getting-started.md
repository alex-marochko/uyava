# Getting Started

Uyava is a developer tool for Flutter that visualizes architecture and runtime activity as a 2D graph. It comes in three options:

- **DevTools Extension (Free):** runs inside Flutter DevTools for day-to-day debugging.
- **Desktop App (Free):** better performance, IDE integration, and basic recording + preview of .uyava logs.
- **Desktop Pro (Paid upgrade):** advanced replay controls and deeper navigation of .uyava logs.

If you are new to Uyava, start with the DevTools extension or the free desktop app to explore your running app. Upgrade to Desktop Pro when you need deeper replay and navigation for long sessions.

## What you need

- A Flutter app that can run with DevTools enabled.
- The Uyava DevTools extension (once published) or a local build.
- Optional: the free desktop app and a Pro license for advanced replay.
