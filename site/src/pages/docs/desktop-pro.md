# Desktop Pro: Recording and Replay

The Pro desktop app focuses on capturing longer sessions and replaying them offline. This helps when you need to analyze large datasets or share sessions with your team.

## What it provides

- Recording and replay workflows.
- Offline analysis without a live device attached.
- More space and context for long-running sessions.

Planned features like LLM-assisted insights are not part of the current Pro release.
