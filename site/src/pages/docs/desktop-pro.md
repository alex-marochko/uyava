# Desktop Pro: Advanced Replay

The free desktop app already lets you record sessions and preview .uyava logs. Desktop Pro unlocks advanced replay controls and deeper navigation for long investigations.

## What the free desktop app includes

- Better performance than web-based tooling.
- IDE integration to jump from map or events to code.
- Recording and basic preview of .uyava logs.

## What Desktop Pro adds

- Advanced replay controls with a seekbar.
- Deeper navigation across .uyava logs.
- Priority for feature requests and bug fixes.

Planned features like LLM-assisted insights are not part of the current Pro release.
