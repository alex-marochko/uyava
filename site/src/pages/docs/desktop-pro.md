# Desktop Pro

Desktop Pro is a paid upgrade for teams who work with long sessions, large graphs, and deep replay workflows.

## Free vs Pro

Free Desktop includes:

- live graph view
- IDE integration
- basic recording and preview of `.uyava` logs

Desktop Pro adds:

- advanced replay controls with a seekbar
- deeper navigation across long recordings
- priority for feature requests and bug fixes

## Replay workflow

When you open a `.uyava` file:

- Desktop switches to File mode.
- The timeline lets you scrub and play recorded events.
- Event markers highlight moments of activity.

Pro expands this with faster seeking and navigation controls, making it practical to review multi-minute or multi-hour logs.

## When to upgrade

Upgrade to Pro if you:

- need to investigate large production sessions
- replay logs frequently for triage and onboarding
- want advanced navigation tools for .uyava archives
