# Uyava (public)

This repository currently hosts:
- `site/` for the public website and docs (Astro static site)
- `site/public/remote_config.json` for the desktop remote config (support links + update metadata)
- `legal_3.zip` as the source of truth for legal documents

The main Uyava codebase will be published here later.
